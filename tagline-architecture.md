## What NOT to Say

**Avoid these alternatives:**
- ❌ "Your one-stop station for reimbursements" (clichéd)
- ❌ "Claim smarter, not harder" (doesn't translate)
- ❌ "Never miss your reimbursement train" (confusing metaphor)
- ❌ "Station yourself for success" (too clever)
- ❌ "Peace of mind for every claim" (generic insurance speak)

**Why the recommended taglines are better:**
- Shorter, punchier
- More distinctive
- Better international translation
- Stronger brand connection
