# ClaimStation Brand Guidelines

## Logos

There are three primary logos:

1.  A static *rose curve* device:
    ![ClaimStation logo - rose curve device - static]

2.  An animated *rose curve* device:
    ![ClaimStation logo - rose curve device - animated]

3.  The word "ClaimStation" in *Fraunces Light Italic* font, with the "C" and
    the "S" a font size 7*6 larger than the other letters.  The initial letter
    "C" and the string "Station" are all lowered by the same amount.  They are
    lowered such that the top of the "C" is at the same level as it would have
    been had it remained having the same size and baseline as the "laim"
    letters.  The letter kerning is adjusted to cause the word's width to be
    11/2 the word's height.
    ![ClaimStation logo - word]

Secondary logos:

-   The static *rose curve* device (on the left) followed by the stylised word
    (on the right).  The height of the device should be 3/2 the height of the
    word.  The gap between the device and the "C" of "ClaimStation" should be
    1/6 of the height of the device.

## Fonts

Use *Fraunces* font for top-level headings and *Inter* for general text.
You may use one other font of your choosing.

## ClaimStation Tagline Architecture

Use a three-tier tagline system:

### Brand tagline (short & memorable)

- "Reclaim what's yours"

### Explanatory tagline (functional)

- "Never lose track of money you're owed"

### Supporting copy (detailed):

- "Track health insurance, work expenses, and government reimbursements in one
  simple app."
