# ClaimStation Brand Guidelines

## Logos

There are three primary logos:

1.  A static *rose curve* device:
    ![ClaimStation logo - rose curve device - static]

2.  An animated *rose curve* device:
    ![ClaimStation logo - rose curve device - animated]

3.  The word "ClaimStation" in *Fraunces Light Italic* font, with the "C" and
    the "S" a font size 7*6 larger than the other letters, but lowered so the
    tops of those letters are at the same height as if they were the same size
    as the other letters and not lowered.  The letter kerning is adjusted to
    cause the word's width to be 11/2 the word's height.
    ![ClaimStation logo - word]

Secondary logos:

-   The static *rose curve* device (on the left) followed by the stylised word
    (on the right).  The height of the device should be 3/2 the height of the
    word.  The gap between the device and the "C" of "ClaimStation" should be
    1/6 of the height of the device.

## Fonts

Use *Fraunces* font for top-level headings and *Inter* for general text.
You may use one other font of your choosing.

## ClaimStation Tagline Architecture

Use a three-tier tagline system:

### Brand tagline (short & memorable)

- "Reclaim what's yours"

### Explanatory tagline (functional)

- "Never lose track of money you're owed"

### Supporting copy (detailed):

- "Track health insurance, work expenses, and government reimbursements in one
  simple app."
