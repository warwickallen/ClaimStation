# Commit Message Formatting

This rule adds line-length limits to the existing Conventional Commits format
(see `implementation.mdc` and `agentic-automation.mdc` where applicable). Both apply.

When writing commit messages, follow these line-length limits:

1. **Subject line**: Maximum 50 characters
2. **Body lines**: No line may exceed 72 characters

Wrap long body text onto multiple lines. Keep the subject concise and imperative.

## Example

```
feat(claims): add status workflow

Introduce workflow states for claims: draft, submitted, approved, and
rejected. Each state restricts allowed transitions.
```
