# Feature Request Implementation (App Only)

**App-only**: This rule applies only when working in the ClaimStation app (`claimstation-app`). Ignore it when working in claimstation-www or other directories.

When `claimstation-app/.cursor/agent-jobs/current.json` contains a `github_issue` with `feedback_type: "feature"`: use the job body as source of truth; implement following project conventions (types from `claimstation-app/src/types/`, Supabase from `claimstation-app/src/lib/supabase/`, patterns from `.cursor/rules/`); run `npm run type-check`; write completion file to `claimstation-app/.cursor/agent-jobs/completed/<github_issue_number>.json`. Follow `agent-queue.mdc` for full workflow.

When the user asks ad hoc: direct them to GitHub or suggest `/agent` on the issue or submit via feedback. Implement the described feature; avoid scope creep; if declining use `resolutionStatus: "not_planned"` with notes.
