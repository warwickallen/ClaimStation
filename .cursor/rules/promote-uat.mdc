# Promote UAT

When the user says **"Promote UAT"** (case-insensitive), the agent should:

1. **Examine the changes** —
   Review the commits and diff between `UAT` and `main` (e.g. `git log main..UAT`, `git diff main...UAT`)
2. **Create a Pull Request** —
   Open a PR merging the `UAT` branch into the `main` branch
3. **Use meaningful title and description** —
   Summarise what the PR contains; base the content on the changes examined

Do not add boilerplate stating that the PR promotes from UAT/Staging to
Production — that is implied by merging into `main`.  Likewise, do not state
"Promote UAT" (or similar), as that is also obvious and implicit.

## Context

- Applies when working in **claimstation-app**
- Base: `main`, head: `UAT`
- See `claimstation-app/docs/en/tech/operations/uat-promotion.md` for the runbook
