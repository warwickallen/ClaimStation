# claimstation-app Branch Policy

When working in **claimstation-app**, agents MUST NOT push or commit directly to the `main` branch. Updates to `main` must go through Pull Requests.

## Before Pushing

1. **Confirm your branch**: Ensure you are on **UAT** or a **feature branch**, never on `main`.
2. **If on main**: Check out UAT or create a feature branch before making changes.

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# If on main, switch to UAT
git checkout UAT

# Or create a feature branch
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

## Workflow

| Branch | Push allowed | Deployment |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **UAT** | Yes | stage.claimstation.app |
| **Feature branches** | Yes | (after merging to UAT) |
| **main** | No | Promote via PR only |

## Promoting to Production

- Merge UAT → main via a Pull Request
- Do not push directly to main
- See `claimstation-app/docs/en/tech/operations/uat-promotion.md` for the runbook

## Summary

- Work on **UAT** or **feature branches** only
- Push to UAT/feature branches as usual; monitor CI
- Promote to `main` via PR only; never `git push origin main`
