# Testing Standards (App Only)

**App-only**: This rule applies only when working in the ClaimStation app (`claimstation-app`). Ignore it when working in claimstation-www or other directories.

Use Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests. Unit tests: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`. E2E tests: `*.spec.ts` in `claimstation-app/e2e/`. Use React Testing Library with Vitest for component tests. Mock Supabase via `@/lib/supabase/client` in tests.
