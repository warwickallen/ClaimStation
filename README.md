# ClaimStation

This is the parent repo for **ClaimStation** — an application for tracking and
managing reimbursement claims (health insurance, work expenses, government
subsidies, etc).  It contains two projects: one for the application and one
for the marketing website.  Each project has its own README with setup, script,
and deployment details.  Work in the subdirectory for the project you are
changing.
