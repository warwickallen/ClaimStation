# ClaimStation

This is the parent repository for **ClaimStation** — an application for tracking
and managing reimbursement claims (health insurance, work expenses, government
subsidies, etc).  It contains two project components: one for the application
and one for the marketing website.  Each project component has its own README
with setup, script, and deployment details.  Work in the subdirectory for the
project component you are changing.

## Project Components

Each project component:
- is in a subdiectory of this project,
- is git-ignored by this parent repository, and
- has its own repository.
